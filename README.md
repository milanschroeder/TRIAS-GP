# The changing global order from a European perspective: A computational text analysis of the European Commission’s portrayals of international relations 1990-2024
## by Milan Schröder & Christian Rauh (WZB)

### Paper Abstract:
Amidst debates about the EU’s unclear international role, its growing competition with China and the US, and the alleged geopoliticisation of its decision-making, this paper focusses on the European Commission as a key supranational actor in the EU and analyses what structures its perspective on the international order between 1990 and 2024. We exploit a new, original corpus containing more than 70.000 speeches, statements, press releases, and other public communications of the Commission and combine advanced computational techniques—transformer-based policy classification, named entity recognition, and latent semantic scaling—to extract which third countries the Commission mentions and how it frames each of them on a continuum between partners and rivals. Aggregating this data to annualized time series across 21 policy areas then allows us to study which country-level characteristics—proximity, economic and military power, regime type, and trade dependencies—structure these portrayals of the EU’s international counterparts and how that has changed over time. This systematic approach provides new insights into the EC’s ambitions in shaping the global order, addresses critical questions about the proactive versus reactive nature of its agenda-setting in this regard, and offers innovative methods to study geopolitics through political communication – thereby contributing to broader debates on Europe’s global strategy in an increasingly competitive international environment.
